abstract = {This paper proposes a novel nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, called Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), which mimics the social behavior of humpback whales. The algorithm is inspired by the bubble-net hunting strategy. WOA is tested with 29 mathematical optimization problems and 6 structural design problems. Optimization results prove that the WOA algorithm is very competitive compared to the state-of-art meta-heuristic algorithms as well as conventional methods. The source codes of the WOA algorithm are publicly available at http://www.alimirjalili.com/WOA.html}

abstract = {One of the main issues with heuristics and meta-heuristics is the local optima stagnation phenomena. It is often called premature convergence, which refers to the assumption of a locally optimal solution as the best solution for an optimization problem and failure in finding the global optimum. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) has demonstrated its merits in the optimization area. Though WOA is an effective algorithm, it may suffer from a low exploration of the search space. In this work, an enhanced WOA (WOAmM) is proposed. The mutualism phase from Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS) is modified and integrated with WOA to alleviate premature convergence's inherent drawback. The addition of a modified mutualism phase with WOA makes the algorithm a balanced one to explore search space more extensively and avoid wasting computational resources in excessive exploitation. The proposed WOAmM method is tested on 36 benchmark functions and IEEE CEC 2019 function suite. It is compared with a wide range of algorithms, including improved WOAs and other meta-heuristics. Statistical analyses and convergence analysis are performed as well to examine its effectiveness and convergence speed. In addition, six real-world engineering optimization problems are solved by the proposed method. The performance is compared with a wide range of existing algorithms to inspect the problem-solving capability of WOAmM. The results demonstrate the performance improvement of WOAmM and its superiority over different algorithms.}

    abstract = "{The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a recently developed meta-heuristic optimization algorithm which is based on the hunting mechanism of humpback whales. Similarly to other meta-heuristic algorithms, the main problem faced by WOA is slow convergence speed. So to enhance the global convergence speed and to get better performance, this paper introduces chaos theory into WOA optimization process. Various chaotic maps are considered in the proposed chaotic WOA (CWOA) methods for tuning the main parameter of WOA which helps in controlling exploration and exploitation. The proposed CWOA methods are benchmarked on twenty well-known test functions. The results prove that the chaotic maps (especially Tent map) are able to improve the performance of WOA.HighlightsChaos has been introduced into WOA to improve its performance.Ten chaotic maps have been investigated to tune the key parameter ‘ p’ of WOA.The proposed CWOA is validated on a set of twenty benchmark functions.The proposed CWOA is validated on a set of twenty benchmark functions.Statistical results suggest that CWOA has better reliability of global optimality.}",
